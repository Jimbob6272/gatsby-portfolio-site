# Hi, I'm Jim 

I'm a frontend developer with 10 years of professional experience creating, managing, and supporting websites. I've been very fortunate in my career to have worked on a wide range of web projects such as ecommerce, SEO/SEM marketing, content strategy, and domain management. This diverse experience allows me to easily integrate into any web team and contribute to projects where needed.
